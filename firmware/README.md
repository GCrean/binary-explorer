# USB Blaster Firmware #

The USB Blaster firmware is based entirely on published work from http://sa89a.net/mp.cgi/ele/ub.htm

The firmware in this repository is a copy of the "0.7" release, and has been slightly updated to include two additional clock outputs:

1) A xxxx KHz "fast clock"
2) A 1 Hz "slow clock"

These two clocks are routed to the CPLD, and can be used during development to clock your logic circuits.
